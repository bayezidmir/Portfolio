          You might be wondering why am I calling myself a software engineer.
          Well, being a full-time service holder, I have been working so hard on
          learing web development. As of today, I have managed to learn HTML,
          CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. In addition, I have enrolled for the
          the complete web development course being offered by Jhankar Mahbub.
          Therefore, I bet, I can become an efficient and competent software
          Engineer, In Sha Allah.

            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
